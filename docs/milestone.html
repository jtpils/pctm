    <!--interpreted .ply files to get all the points and render it-->
    <p>
        So far, we have written code to parse the input .ply files and to perform the preliminary steps of the
        ball-pivoting algorithm. Specifically, of the four major operations (spatial hashing, seed selection,
        ball-pivoting and join/glue) outlined in the reference paper, we have made progress toward completing the first
        two. Our first task was to create a spatial grid of the vertices that were parsed from the .ply files. For seed
        selection, we have also figured out a way to find the center of a ball that touches all 3 vertices of a
        potential seed triangle.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are currently working on a method for estimating vertex normals, which we realized are required by the
        algorithm and are not given in the input files, as well as finishing up code for the ball-pivoting and join/glue
        portions of the algorithm.

    <h2 align="left">Reflection of Progress</h2>
    <p>
        After having the .ply files converted and almost being done with find seed triangle, we just need to continue to
        follow the pseudocode from the research paper on the ball-pivoting algorithm and do testing.
        We believe that we are on track to figure out the ball-pivoting algorithm to create a mesh from a point cloud.
