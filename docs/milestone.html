    <!--interpreted .ply files to get all the points and render it-->
    <p>
        So far, we have written code to parse the input .ply files and to perform the preliminary steps of the
        ball-pivoting algorithm. Specifically, of the four major operations (spatial hashing, seed selection,
        ball-pivoting and join/glue) outlined in the reference paper, we have made progress toward completing the first
        two.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our first task was to create a spatial grid of the vertices that were parsed from the .ply files. This was
        done through the same way we did in project 4. We created a map that maps a hashcode position to a list of
        points. This gave us quicker access to neighboring points. For seed selection, we have also figured out a way to
        find the center of a ball that touches all 3 vertices of a potential seed triangle.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are currently working on a method for estimating vertex normals, which we realized are required by the
        algorithm and are not given in the input files, as well as finishing up code for the ball-pivoting and join/glue
        portions of the algorithm.

    <h2 align="left">Reflection of Progress</h2>
    <p>
        After having the .ply files converted and almost being done with find seed triangle, we just need to continue to
        follow the pseudocode from the research paper on the ball-pivoting algorithm and do testing. The code that we
        need to work on after finding the seed triangle is figuring out the glue and join helper functions that go with
        the ball-pivoting algorithm. With those three ball-pivoting helper functions created, hopefully we can easily
        implement the ball-pivoting algorithm and test our code. We believe that we are on track to figure out the
        ball-pivoting algorithm by the time the final deliverables are due.
