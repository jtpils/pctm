<h3 align="middle">Title: Point Cloud to Mesh</h3>

<h3 align="middle">Summary</h3>
<p>
In this project, we will implement algorithms for reconstructing 3D surfaces (meshes) from point clouds. This type of conversion is useful as many 3D scanning technologies capture data in the point cloud format, and 3D meshes provide for more intuitive interpretation and manipulation in graphics applications.

<h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
<!--
Problem Description
Here you should provide the context for your idea. Describe the problem that you are trying to solve, why it is important, where it is challenging. Give us a general idea on how you are going to solve it.
-->
<p>
The general problem that this project addresses is the question of how to capture the 3D geometry of some object in the real world, and then transform the data into a useful digital representation. Today, this is commonly accomplished via 3D scanning technologies such as coordinate measuring machines, laser scanners, or ultrasound scanners. Typically, these technologies work by capturing the geometry of an object by sampling depth at certain 2D coordinates along a certain plane , then combining the depth information with the 2D coordinates to form 3D points. This process results in a point cloud, which is essentially just the raw collection of points. While this type of representation may be good enough in order to interpret the geometry of the captured object, transforming point clouds into surface representations such as meshes is often useful for further manipulation of the data in CAD applications, for instance.
</p>

<p>
This problem can be challenging to solve in the sense that point clouds do not inherently convey any sense of orientation or connectivity. In addition, because collecting point cloud data is a sampling process, it is susceptible to noise and aliasing. Therefore, good solutions must be able to robustly handle these issues. In our implementations, we intend to deduce surface information by approximating alpha shapes (generalizations of the convex hull), and surface indicator functions (3D functions that are 1 at points on the interior of a surface and 0 elsewhere).
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
<!--
Goals and Deliverables
This is the most important part of your proposal. You should carefully think through what you are trying to accomplish, what results you are going for, and why you think you can accomplish those goals. For example:
Since this is a graphics class you will likely define the kind of images you will create (e.g. including a photo of a new lighting effect you will simulate).
If you are working on an interactive system, describe what demo you will create.
Define how you will measure the quality / performance of your system (e.g. graphs showing speedup, or quantifying accuracy). It may not be possible to define precise target metrics at this time, but we encourage you to try.
What questions do you plan to answer with your analysis?
You should break this section into two parts: (1) what you plan to deliver, and (2) what you hope to deliver. In (1), describe what you believe you must accomplish to have a successful project and achieve the grade you expect (i.e. your baseline plan - planning for some unexpected problems would make sense). In (2), describe what you hope to achieve if things go well and you get ahead of schedule (your aspirational plan).
-->
<p>
Because the goal of this project is to reconstruct 3D meshes, we naturally intend to deliver example reconstructions in the form of images (png) and mesh (dae) files. To generate these, we will use our reconstruction implementations together with MeshEdit, which provides infrastructure to draw and screen capture the surface of a mesh.
</p>

<p>
In order to gauge the quality of our implementation, we will test it on benchmark meshes such as the Stanford bunny and dragon that we have already seen in this class from Project 3. In addition to comparing these to the provided mesh reconstructions from the Stanford repository, we will compare our reconstructions with other reconstructions generated by ready-made point cloud converters available for download online. By comparing against other peopleâ€™s implementations using the same algorithm, we can obtain a sense of the accuracy and correctness of our own implementation.
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Achievable Deliverables</h3>
<p>
For this project, we strongly intend (plan) to deliver a working implementation of the ball-pivoting surface reconstruction algorithm described here [TODO: LINK IBM PAPER], along with the accompanying files for comparison as described above. We believe this should be feasible to achieve as the ball-pivoting algorithm is described as relatively simple to understand and implement compared to other surface reconstruction algorithms.
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Ambitious Deliverables</h3>
<p>
In the case that we do well (quality and time-wise) with the ball-pivoting algorithm, we will attempt to implement more state-of-the-art algorithms such as Poisson Surface Reconstruction, or Voronoi-Based Variational Reconstruction of Unoriented Point Sets. The deliverables for these would be the same as for ball-pivoting, just achieved with a different algorithm.
</p>


<h2 align="middle">Proposed Schedule</h2>
<!--
Schedule
In this section you should organize and plan the tasks and subtasks that your team will execute. Since presentations are ~4 weeks from the due-date of the proposal, you should include a set of tasks for every week.
-->

<h2 align="middle">Resources</h2>
<!--
Resources
List what resources, e.g. books, papers and/or online resources that are references for your project. List the computing platform, hardware and software resources that you will use for your project. You have a wide latitude here to use what you have access to, but be aware that you will have to support and trouble-shoot on your platform yourselves. If you are starting from an existing piece of code or system, describe and provide a pointer to it here.
-->

<!-- TEMPLATE STUFF BELOW
    <p>Here is an example of how to include a simple formula:</p>
    <p align="middle"><pre align="middle">a^2 + b^2 = c^2</pre></p>
    <p>or, alternatively, you can include an SVG image of a LaTex formula.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">A Few Notes On Webpages</h2>
        <p>Here are a few problems students have encountered in the past. You will probably encounter these problems at some point, so don't wait until right before the deadline to check that everything is working. Test your website on the instructional machines early!</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Your main report page should be called index.html.</li>
        <li>Be sure to include and turn in all of the other files (such as images) that are linked in your report!</li>
        <li>Use only <em>relative</em> paths to files, such as <pre>"./images/image.jpg"</pre>
        Do <em>NOT</em> use absolute paths, such as <pre>"/Users/student/Desktop/image.jpg"</pre></li>
        <li>Pay close attention to your filename extensions. Remember that on UNIX systems (such as the instructional machines), capitalization matters. <pre>.png != .jpeg != .jpg != .JPG</pre>
        <li>Be sure to adjust the permissions on your files so that they are world readable. For more information on this please see this tutorial: <a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Permissions.html">http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Permissions.html</a></li>
        <li>And again, test your website on the instructional machines early!</li>
